                Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin  was a Russian Romantic composer of Georgian origin. He was one of the prominent
                19th-century composers known as The Mighty Handful, a group dedicated to producing a uniquely Russian kind of classical
                music, rather than imitating earlier Western European models. Borodin is best known for his symphonies, his two
                string quartets, the tone poem In the Steppes of Central Asia and his opera Prince Igor. Music from Prince Igor and his
                string quartets was later adapted for the US musical Kismet.

                A doctor and chemist by profession, Borodin made important early contributions to the field of organic chemistry.
                Although today he is better known as a composer, during his lifetime, he regarded medicine and science as his primary
                occupations, only pursuing music and composition in his spare time or when he was ill. As a chemist, Borodin is best
                known for his work in organic synthesis, including being among the first chemists to demonstrate nucleophilic
                substitution, as well as being the co-discoverer of the aldol reaction. A notable advocate of women's rights,
                Borodin was a promoter of education in Russia and founded the School of Medicine for Women in Saint Petersburg, where
                he taught until 1885.
